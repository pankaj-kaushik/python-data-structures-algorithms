# 🧪 Python DSA Labs

Python DSA Labs is a personal learning repository containing implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms in Python created for experimentation, practice, and concept building.

This repository contains **small, focused working code examples**, each living in its own folder, designed to:
- understand conceptual concept
- explore real-world use cases
- prepare for interviews
- learn problem-solving techniques
- understand complexity analysis

⚠️ This repo is **not production-ready**. The goal is learning by building.

**Each experiment:**
- is self-contained
- has its own dependencies
- can be run independently

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn from This Repo

By going through these experiments, you will learn:

- Core Data Structures implementation from scratch
- Standard algorithmic techniques
- Interview-oriented problem-solving approaches
- Complexity analysis (Time & Space)
- Clean and structured Python coding practices

**Perfect for:**

- Beginners/Undergraduate learning DSA
- Software engineers preparing for interview

## 🛠 Tech Stack
Common stack used across experiments:
- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Version Control** Git & GitHub
- **IDE:** VS Code (recommended)

## ⚙️ Environment Setup (One-Time)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-dsa-labs.git
cd python-dsa-labs
```
### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
Activate it:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```bash
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## ▶️ How to Run Example
Each example follows the same basic flow.

### Step 1: Move into the example folder
```bash
cd data-structures/<example-name>
```
### Step 2: Run the application
```bash
python filename.py
```
**📌 Always check the experiment’s README for exact commands.**

## 🧪 How to Add a New Example
Follow this standard structure:
```text
data-structures/
└── example-name/
    ├── filename.py
    ├── README.md 
```
Best practices:
- Focus on one concept
- Keep code minimal & readable
- Document:
  - what the experiment does
  - what you will learn
  - how to run it
  - edge cases

## 📚 Coding Format Followed:
Each implementation includes:
- Problem / Concept
- Approach Explanation
- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity
- Clean Python Implementation
**Example**
```text
Problem: Binary Search
Approach: Divide and conquer
Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1
```
